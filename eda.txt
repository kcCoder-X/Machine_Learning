1. DATASET OVERVIEW
   Rows:891
   Columns:12
   Target variable: Survived(0 = NO, 1 = Yes)

| Feature     | Type                  | Meaning              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| PassengerId | Identifier            | Unique ID            |
| Survived    | Target                | Survival status      |
| Pclass      | Categorical (Ordinal) | Ticket class (1,2,3) |
| Name        | Text                  | Passenger name       |
| Sex         | Categorical           | Male/Female          |
| Age         | Numerical             | Passenger age        |
| SibSp       | Numerical             | Siblings/Spouses     |
| Parch       | Numerical             | Parents/Children     |
| Ticket      | Categorical           | Ticket number        |
| Fare        | Numerical             | Ticket fare          |
| Cabin       | Categorical           | Cabin number         |
| Embarked    | Categorical           | Port of embarkation  |

2. Missing value Analysis
   Cabin -> Too many missing values(usually dropped)
   Age -> Important Feature(impute{median or model-based})
   Embarked -> Only 2 so filled with model

3. Target variable distribution
   From the survival count plot:
   Not Survived:~549
   Survived:~342

   Insight
   DATASET is slightly imbalanced so accuracy alone is not enogh, precision and recall matter
  
4. Numerical feature Analysis
   Age
   Range:0.4 - 80 years
   Most passengers: 20 - 40 years
   Right skewed distribution(mean>median>mode)

   Key Insight
   Children and younger passengers had higher survival probability

   Fare 
   Highly right skewed as many low fares, few very expensive tickets
   Better if applied Log transgormation during modeling

5. Categorical feature insights(critical for ML)
   Sex:
   Male:577
   Female:314

   Survival insights:
   females survived significantly more than male
   strong predictive feature

   Passenger class
   3rd class -> Most passengers
   1st class -> Higher Survival Rate
   Socio-economic status mattered a lot

   Embarked
   Most from southampton
   Some missing so filled with mode

6. Feature Relationships for Business Logic

| Feature     | Relationship with Survival    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Sex         | Females > Males               |
| Pclass      | 1st > 2nd > 3rd               |
| Age         | Children > Adults             |
| Fare        | Higher fare → Higher survival |
| Family Size | Small families survived more  |

7. Data cleaning strategy 
   Drop(PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)
   Impute(Age, Embarked)
   
   Feature Engineering
   FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1
   IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1 else 0

1️⃣ train_test_split()
A function from sklearn.model_selection that divides your dataset into train (for model learning) and test (for evaluation).
Inputs: features (X) and target (y).
Outputs: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test.

2️⃣ test_size=0.2
20% of the data will be reserved for testing.
80% will be used for training the model.

3️⃣ random_state=42
Ensures reproducibility.
The split will always be the same if you use this random seed.
Otherwise, every run could split the data differently.

4️⃣ stratify=y
Ensures that the proportion of classes in the target y is the same in both train and test sets.
Example: If 40% survived and 60% didn’t in the original dataset, the same ratio is maintained in y_train and y_test.
Important for imbalanced datasets like Titanic.

1️⃣ Why Feature Scaling?
Features like Age, Fare, SibSp, etc., may have very different ranges.
Example: Age might range from 0–80, Fare from 0–500+.
Logistic Regression (and many ML algorithms) assumes features are on a similar scale to perform efficiently.
Without scaling:
Large-range features dominate the optimization process.
Model may converge slowly or give biased coefficients.

2️⃣ StandardScaler()
Standardizes features to have:
Mean = 0
Standard deviation = 1
Formula applied to each feature:
𝑋scaled=( X - mean(X) ) / std(X)

3️⃣ fit_transform vs transform
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
fit_transform() does two things on training data:
Fit: Computes the mean and standard deviation of each feature in X_train.
Transform: Scales X_train using the computed mean & std.

X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
Only transform X_test using the mean and std from X_train.
✅ Important: Do NOT fit on test data, otherwise you leak information from the test set.

4️⃣ Effect
All features are now on the same scale, making the model training more stable and improving convergence.
Logistic Regression coefficients now reflect true relationships between features and the target.
